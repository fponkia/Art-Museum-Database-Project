Project Name: Art Museum Database project

This project was done in a group of 3 members and was part of the relational database course (CPSC 304) taken at the University of British Columbia (UBC).

This project is about creating a database for an art museum company that has multiple locations in the world. This database collects all types of information such as registering all the information of the customer, ticket info, gallery information, exhibition details, artist information, art information, and critic information for any particular art piece. This database also collects and stores information for the auctions as well such as auctioneer, collector, and the price a particular art piece is sold for.

The database contains all the data in the 3NF normalization, which helps in preserving all the functional dependencies preserving while removing most of the redundancy. This database also implements sanitization before querying, to avoid unlawful injection and make the database safe from accidental errors.
